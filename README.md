# surface-mesh-generation
a project with vs2010 to generate surface triangular mesh
there are still some bugs need to repair, but it almost does not affect your using.
when i am free, i will fix it and upload the new version.
the programe uses no third lib, so it is easy to be reappeared.
more information and detail, please read the paper "基于球填充法的STL模型曲面自适应网格生成方法".
